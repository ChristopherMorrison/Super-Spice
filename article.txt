b'The rules of Tinder are pretty simple: You swipe right, or you swipe left. You like someone\'s profile (right), or you don\'t (left). Occasionally, you might send a Super Likethe digital version of showing up at someone\'s doorstep, bouquet of flowers in hand, blasting "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer out of a boomboxbut otherwise, there\'s not much nuance. The Tinderverse exists in black and white.But those simple decisions translate into a lot of data. Every time you swipe right, Tinder learns a clue about what you look for in a potential match. The more you swipe, the closer Tinder becomes to piecing together the mosaic of your dating preferences. As millions of people spend hours flicking their thumbs across their screens, Tinder\'s data scientists are carefully watching.Today, the company puts some of that data to use with a new feature called Super Likeable, which uses machine learning to predict which profiles youre most likely to swipe right on. Those profiles will pop up periodically in groups of four, and users will be able to send one of them a bonus Super Like. (Yes, you have to send a Super Like. Tinder claims that doing so "increases your likelihood of matching by three times," though some people would argue that Super Likes seem a little desperate.)More on TinderAlana Hope LevinsonCan Women Build A Better Tinder?Elizabeth StinsonThis Robot Is Better at Tinder Than YouJon MooallemSorry, But if You\'re Married, Browsing Tinder Totally Makes You a SnakeSuper Likeable builds on a machine learning tool called TinVec, which Tinder announced earlier this month at the Machine Learning Conference in San Francisco. The proprietary tool sifts through vast amounts of swiping data to find patternslike your tendency to dig men with beardsand then searches for new profiles that fit those patterns. Tinder then adds those profiles to your swiping queue. The more you swipe, the sharper the predictions become, and (theoretically, at least) the more likely you are to swipe right on the profiles Tinder expects you will.Tinder won\'t explain exactly how its algorithms work, but Brian Norgard, Tinders chief product officer, says Super Likeable synthesizes all kinds of data from a user\'s past swipes to predict future matches. TinVec relies on users past swiping behavior, but that swiping behavior takes into account multiple factors, both physical and otherwise, Norgard says. The beauty of AI is that it incorporates all of those inputs into its ranking system.Dating GamesTinder already uses machine learning to fine-tune other aspects of the matchmaking process. Last year, it introduced a feature called Smart Photos, which prioritizes users profile pictures based on which one is most likely to earn a right swipe. It also developed Smart Profiles to surface things in common, like a shared hometown or a mutual interest in videogames.Tinder\'s greatest asset in developing these kinds of algorithms may be the overwhelming amount of data the app collects from its massive user base. There are roughly 26 million matches on Tinder every day. That adds up to over 20 billion matches made since Tinder launched five years ago. Using all that information on who likes who, Tinder says its TinVec algorithms can accurately predict who you\'ll like next with shocking accuracy. In other words: Tinder knows who you\'ll swipe right on long before you ever see the person\'s profile in the app.The idea behind Super Likeable is to surface these profiles faster. From a user\'s perspective, that should get you closer to swiping right on the people you actually like more often. But Super Likeable also provides a way for Tinder to better train its matching algorithms. Heres a batch of profiles that Tinder predicted youd be most likely to swipe right on. Whether you do or not is a way for Tinder to check if its getting the equation right, and then adjust its algorithms accordingly.For now, Tinders only rolling out Super Likeable to users in Los Angeles and New York. And since Tinder needs enough swiping data to curate recommendations, not everyone will see a Super Likeable box right away. "The more a user swipes, the better our recommendations will be, so there is a threshold before a user will see a Super Likeable card," he says. When a Super Likeable box does pop up, it\'ll always offer four profiles and one Super Like.Hot or NotIn some ways, the feature seems to further reduce the matching process to criteria on a checklist, resurfacing the same "types" that people already know they like: men with beards, or women who wear glasses. Algorithms are good at finding the profiles that include photos of beards or glasses, and not so good at determining human chemistry.Norgard says it\'s not quite so simple. Sometimes people may think they want one thing, but then when they see something totally different that interests them, it helps them realize that their original filtering criteria might not have been entirely accurate, he says. The beauty of our swiping-based algorithms is that peoples actions tend to be true to what they really want, not what they think they want."Either way, Super Likeable promises to be the next step in Tinder\'s quest to understand exactly which type of people you\'ll swipe right on. As the app collects more and more data about your swiping behavior, it will curate more and more recommendationsuntil someday, maybe, Tinder will know exactly who you\'ll date long before you do.'

b'The rain is drenching Darryl "Curtains" Jackson. It\'s coming down in sheets from a machine overhead that\'s been programmed to dump water droplets at the rate of 3.25 inches an hour. "This is a nice, steady rain," he says, as drops fall from the ceiling and drain into the grated floor below.Curtains, Converse\'s apparel director, is standing in the middle of the rain tower, a silvery box inside the biophysics lab at the Maryland campus of Gore, the company that makes waterproof and breathable Gore-Tex fabrics. The tower is designed to simulate nasty weather of all kindsslanted downpours, harsh winds, insistent drizzleso Gore can test the efficacy of the materials it manufactures.Even in this fabricated deluge, Curtains doesn\'t need an umbrella. Today, he\'s wearing a hooded black zip-up jacket and orange and green high top sneakers. They\'re part of the Urban Utility collection, a new line of weatherproof mens shoes and outerwear Converse has produced in partnership with Gore. Urban Utility is Converse\'s first crack at truly technical products, and Curtains is putting them through the ringer. Ten minutes into the rain test, and the jacket and shoes are holding up. Curtains still isn\'t wet. "I feel like I\'m walking on dry land," he says.Keith Yahrling for WIREDThe line is a departure for Converse. The Nike-owned brand, which just released its first collection of basic apparel last year, is new to clothes. At the same time, Converse\'s shoes aren\'t traditionally known for their ruggedness. A drizzly day can make the company\'s trademark Chuck Taylor canvas sneakers feel like damp paper towels. For a certain type of consumer, the shoe\'s lightweight flimsiness is part of its charm; the more weathered your Chucks, the better they look. Urban Utility, on the other hand, is designed to keep weather out.Kicking BackThe company has a history of making utility shoes that\'s rarely spoken about. When Marquis Mills Converse founded Converse in 1908, his company only produced galoshes and rubber work boots. Later, during World War II, Converse made footwear for soldiers. More recently, the company has collaborated with brands like Hunter to make waterproof Chuck Taylors and has designed a line of water-repellent sneakers.Urban Utility marks Converse\'s first attempt to capture a piece of the growing, frenzied streetwear trend.With Gore-Tex, Converse is attempting to build a more intentionally high-performance collection of goods. The shoes and jacket have Converse\'s casual DNA on the outside and Gore\'s technology on the inside. Adhered to the upper of the line\'s three new pairs of shoes is a thin layer of Gore\'s eponymous material. "You\'ll never see the Gore-Tex unless you want to," says Doug Crawford, an account manager at Gore who oversaw the collaboration with Converse.A few hours before Curtains found himself in the rain room, he, Crawford, and a handful of other Gore employees were touring a different suburban office building where the company conducts most of its shoe-related research. "This is typically the amount of sweat a human foot gives off over the course of a day," says Jonathan Swegle, a footwear engineer at Gore, shaking a small vial of clear liquid. "It\'s a lot of moisture."Gore-Tex is designed to transfer sweat into water vapor, which allows it to pass through the thin lining material, reducing a shoe\'s swamp-foot effect. Meanwhile, Gore-Tex\'s pores are small enough9 billion per square inchthat water droplets can\'t get into the shoe from the outside. If Gore-Tex works, it should keep the foot warm and dry on a cold, rainy day, but cool on a hot day.Stretch GoalsBob Gore first developed the material in the late 1960s when he abruptly yanked a heated rod of polytetrafluoroethylene, a polymer best known for its use in Teflon cookware, just to see what happened. When stretched quickly, solid PTFE expands by more than 800 percent, creating a thin, micro-porous material that is comprised of more than 70 percent air. Gore learned that he could tweak this bio-inert plastic to make it suit all kinds of applications, including medical implants and electrical cables. Its most mainstream use, though, came from fashioning the stuff into a paper-thin membrane that could be woven into clothes or used as lining to create breathable, water-resistant fabrics.Jonathan Swegle.\nKeith Yahrling for WIREDTo make sure the materials used in Converse\'s jacket and shoes are truly waterproof, Gore has set up an extensive testing process inside its labyrinthine office park. The main lab is a brightly lit and filled with machines that stretch, rub, and poke at Gore\'s material. "We have 650 different tests we can perform," says Lynn Owens, a testing manager at Gore. Not every material undergoes every test, she explains. Rather, each material is methodically abused based on how it\'s going to be used out in the world.Consumer products like Converse don\'t need as rigorous of an approval process as military material. Testing typically involves an abrasion test of rubbing the material between two weights to see how long it takes to wear out. Most materials spend dozens if not hundreds of hours in one of Gore\'s 200 Kenmore washers that have been modified to never stop churning. "This is the roughest environment they\'ll ever see," Crawford says of the wash test. Most consumer products take a pass through the biophysics lab\'s rain chamber and another room where rows of bright overhead bulbs simulate blazing sunlight and fans can create temperatures that dip and soar from 58 below to 122 degrees Fahrenheit.Street SmartsIt might seem like overkill, but Converse and Gore have a lot to gain from a successful entrance into the new market middle ground of outdoor gear-meets-city clothes. Part of that success depends on performance; part of depends on cool-factor, which is why Converse worked with popular streetwear store Slam Jam and the Kanye West-approved artist Cali Dewitt to design a few of the line\'s pieces. (The new collection will be available at Slam Jam starting today.)Urban Utility marks Converse\'s first attempt to capture a piece of the growing, frenzied streetwear trend. Gore has already dipped into that stream. The company recently joined a high-profile collaboration between The North Face and Supreme to produce a line of water-slicking gear. Pieces from that collection are now going for upwards of $1,100 on eBay.Back at Gore\'s shoe headquarters, Curtains explains that Converse is known for being accessible, both financially and culturally. Urban Utility, however, is meant to edge into a slightly elevated realm. Converse is hoping the association with Gore-Tex will compel its young customers to drop $400 on an Urban Utility jacket, and north of $150 on boots.Those higher prices aren\'t shocking to anyone who buys apparel from brands like Supreme, which uses exclusivity and high pricing as a marketing tool. But that\'s hardly been Converse\'s game until now. Can the company compete in the rarefied streetwear world? Curtains briefly ponders the question, then answers with confidence. "Absolutely," he says. "Think about the coolest outfit in history of timea black leather jacket, a white t-shirt, blue Levis, and Converse."

b'This holiday season, more people than ever before are giving the gift of spit. Well, whats in your spit, to be precise. Want to know where your ancestors once walked or whether youre at risk for a genetic disease? Theres a spit tube kit for that. And customers are buying them in record numbers.Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, leading personal genomics company AncestryDNA sold about 1.5 million of their testing kits designed to provide insights into your ethnicity and familial connections. Thats like 2,000 gallons of salivaenough to fill a modest above-ground swimming pool with the genetic history of every person in the city of Philadelphia.Ancestry says its equipped to deal with the impending deluge, but the flood of consumer interest has its executives eyeing the long-term prospects of their stretched supply chain. It also has some policymakers and public health officials concerned about the pace with which people are blindly giving away their genetic data to these types of companies, who can turn around and sell it to third parties.At a press conference on Sunday, New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for increased federal scrutiny of the privacy practices of consumer DNA testing companies like Ancestry and its chief rival 23andMe. The Food and Drug Administration already regulates consumer DNA tests related to health, like the 23andMe panel they approved earlier this year. So what exactly does the congressman want? For the Federal Trade Commission to force the firms to extract all their buried fine print about how they might distribute your data, and broadcast it loud and clear. I think if most people knew that this information could be sold to third parties they would think twice, said Schumer. The last gift any of us want to give away this holiday season is our most personal and sensitive information.While theres no evidence that these companies have let anyones genetic data fall into the hands of hackersor anything half that badtheir policies do grant them free rein to host, transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your genetic information. You still technically own your DNA, but they own the rights to whats in itafter its been anonymized and deidentified, of course. Both companies say the primary way they use this genetic data is to improve their products and services. But both have research partnerships that involve exchanging data for money23andMe with drug companies like Pfizer and Genentech, Ancestry with Alphabet longevity spinout Calico.This isnt a videogame, its peoples genetic code and its a very valuable commodity, says Peter Pitts, the president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former FDA associate commissioner. Hed like to see more transparency from Ancestry and 23andMe about how often they resell DNA data and how much they make from it. Thats the only way for people to know what its really worth. To treat it like a toy and put it under the Christmas tree is incredibly irresponsible.But thats exactly what millions of people are going to be doing in just a few short weeks. While Ancestry officials didnt provide exact sales figures for this years Black Friday weekend, they did say they sold three times as many kits as the same time period in 2016, an amount theyd previously reported as 560,000. Going into the long weekend, the company had sold slightly more than six million tests since launching the product in 2012. 23andMe declined to give any financial details, but thanks in part to a big price cut, their health test was one of Amazons five best-selling items on Black Friday, behind the Amazon Echo Dot, two other Alexa add-ons, and a programmable pressure cooker.Amazon has become an increasingly important sales channel for both Ancestry and 23andMe in the two years since they began selling in the home tests section of the two-click shopping platform. But it was particularly huge for Ancestry when the aforementioned pressure cooker sold out late in the day on Monday. From that moment you could just see it take off like a hockey stick, says Ancestry executive vice president and general manager Ken Chahine, still surprised.More on GeneticsSarah ZhangA Single $249 Test Analyzes 30 Cancer Genes. But Do You Need It?Anna VlasitsHow 23andMe Won Back the Right to Foretell Your DiseasesSarah ZhangIllumina, the Google of Genetic Testing, Has Plans for World DominationBut not as surprised, he says, as Amazon. They didnt expect us to sell that much, so they moved a bunch of inventory out of the distribution centers to cold storage, probably in the middle of nowhere and then they had to go track it all down and for a while nobody knew where it was, he says. Its since been sorted out. But if you ordered a kit and it hasnt come yet, at least now you know why.Both Ancestry and 23andMe have acknowledged the criticism that has come with more widespread use of their products. But the companies maintain that their customers understand the tradeoffs and have the opportunity to opt-out at any time. When I interviewed Ancestrys chief scientific officer Catherine Ball at the Commonwealth Club in July, the majority of the audience questions focused on issues of privacy and third party access. We do not own or assert any ownership over your genetics, she told the crowd of about 100. We just see ourselves as stewards, and only do that which our customers have consented us to do.On Sunday night, in response to Schumers remarks, Kate Black, 23andMes privacy officer and corporate counsel, told NBC News something similar: We do not sell individual customer information, nor do we include any customer data in our research program without an individuals voluntary and informed consent. 23andMe customers are in control of their datacustomers can choose to consent, or not to, at any time.Critics like Pitts say thats true but not accurate, if you dig into the fine print. Which, he fears, people will spend even less time doing if they get the tests from a friend or relative. That comes with an implicit endorsement, so people are likely to pay even less attention to the potential risks, he says. A genetic test wont shoot your eye out, but it should be handled with care.

b"Over the course of thousands of years, dogs have evolved alongside humans to be awesome. Unlike their wild ancestors, they don't gnaw on us (usually). They stick up for us. They go to the bathroom in designated areas. They're unrivaled companions. Looking at you disappointingly, cats.Now, though, they have competition. The companion robots that science fiction has promised us for so long have finally hit the United States, and leading the way is an adorable little machine called Kuri. Made by Mayfield Robotics in Silicon Valley, Kuriwhich starts shipping in Decemberwill roll around your house and respond to your voice and recognize faces and take video of your dinner parties, if you're into that sort of thing.Not exactly as useful as Rosie from The Jetsons, but hey, it's early days. And the design evolution of Kuri, from prototype to consumer product, provides a fascinating glimpse into a new era of interaction between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines. The question is: Do humans need or even want this kind of thing? And are we prepared to form a new kind of bond with what is essentially a new kind of being?Kuri sprang from the minds of roboticists Kaijen Hsiao and Sarah Osentoski, who didnt actually start out to make a friendly robot. What they originally conceived of was a security robot that would patrol the home. Not to taser intruders, but to keep an eye out. The problem, the pair eventually realized, is that you're better off detecting someone while theyre still outside. By the time someone gets in the home, well it's kind of too late, isn't it? Hsiao says.A robot with fewer responsibilities seemed a more logical starting point. So Hsiao and Osentoski began building a bot for companionship, instead of protection. But this approach introduced a slew of subtle problems, chief among them: How do you get this new technology to work in the home, while also winning the affection of its owners?First of all, Kuri has to be able to navigate the house without acting like an idiot. To avoid obstacles, it maps the world with lasers, just like a self-driving car. This is the sort of thing thats really making machines like Kuri possiblesensors are getting cheaper at the same time that theyre getting more powerful. You don't have to drop $10K on lidar to get your robot to see its world.Where the design gets subtler is in the look of Kuri. In these early days of personal robotics, its important for manufacturers to nonverbally telegraph what their machines are capable offor safety, in some cases, but mostly to avoid disappointing the user. Do not, for instance, expect Kuri to drag you out of a burning building.We try, through her form, to really communicate exactly what Kuri's capable of, says Osentoski. She doesn't have arms because she's not going to be moving things around your home.Another consideration is how Kuri communicates. We humans tend to anthropomorphize anything that seems even remotely lifelike. Accordingly, Kuris designers decided that it shouldnt speak human. This is because when you have something that's talking to you that's driving around your house you start to expect a lot more, says Osentoski. You start to expect the intelligence of a 3-year-old or a 5-year-old. Kuri just isn't there yet, mentally or physically, so users need to treat it as such.More on RobotsMatt SimonWhat Is a Robot?Matt SimonThis Robot Tractor Is Ready to Disrupt ConstructionMatt SimonInside SynTouch, the Mad Lab Giving Robots the Power to FeelAt the same time, Mayfield Robotics wants Kuri to win your affection and become part of your family, and a lot of that comes down to the eyes. Watch any Pixar movie and youll notice how expressive the eyes are. Humans love eyes. So humans have to love Kuris peepers, which are actually mechanical. That limits their emotive potential compared to, say, just slapping a flatscreen on Kuris face, but they go a long way in telegraphing emotion for a robot that otherwise communicates with beeps and boops.So, put it all together and you get an advanced, weirdly cute robot thats quite remarkable to communicate with. Its limited at the moment, sure, but as someone whos interacted with Kuri, I can tell you that it conjures peculiar feelings. Rub its head and it looks up at you lovingly. I'm impressed by its apparent animalness, yet other times frustrated when it doesn't respond to my commands. I'm fully aware that its a machine meant to play with my emotions and expectations, but I dont really care. In the end, I'm just not fully sure how to interact with it.Whether humans are even ready for companion robots, though, remains to be seen. Think machines that strike up conversations with the elderly and even cuddle with them. I don't believe in companion robots, I'm sorry, says UC Berkeley roboticist Ken Goldberg. I don't think that that's actually what people want. If I'm lonely, the last thing I want is a robot to come in and somehow be my friend. That's even more depressing.Whether Americans fall in love with it or not, Kuri is a technical milestone. And it will only get smarter from here. This is just the beginning of a new kind of relationship that humanity is beginning to form with robots, so prepare for a lot of awkward momentsand powerful ones, too. And bonus: Kuri will never chew up your slippers or assault your postal carrier. Related VideoScienceHow to Live with RobotsSophisticated companion robots have arrived. But we need to be very careful about how we interact with them." 

b'This storyoriginally appeared on Gristand is part of theClimate Deskcollaboration.In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage.Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas.Theres no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when.The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites The Doomsday Glacier.) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the worlds oceansan amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today.To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? Theres growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the worlds coastlinespartially the result of something called marine ice-cliff instability.The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs cant support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable.Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height, explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. We need to know how fast its going to happen.In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this centurymuch more quickly than previously thought.Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which weve never seen.Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesnt raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which wont cause a drink to spill over.)Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise.Antarctica is a giant landmassabout half the size of Africaand the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continents ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges.Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped.A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 yearsmuch too quickly for humanity to adapt.With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago, Poinar says.A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica.Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse, read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollards findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of US cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios.At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the worlds most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map.At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings.DeConto and Pollards breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior.Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as theyre expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today.Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollards model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a business as usual pathmeaning we dont dramatically reduce carbon emissions.Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years.Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.It could happen faster or slower, I dont think we really know yet, says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. But its within the realm of possibility, and thats kind of a scary thing.Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice.The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in.In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Islands glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island.But theres reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.More on Global WarmingMegan MolteniFor Scientists Predicting Sea Level Rise, Wind Is the Biggest UnknownEric NiilerThe Arctic Is Melting, and Fast. But Maybe Data Can Save ItAdam RogersGiant Antarctic Icebergs and Crushing Existential DreadRight now, theres a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.If you remove the ice shelf, theres a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities, says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice, Wise says, it just falls off.And, its not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then theres Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts.Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets.Still, some scientists arent fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is tantalizing evidence. But he says that research doesnt establish how quickly it happened.Theres a whole lot more to understand if were going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat, he says. The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat.Despite the differences of opinion, however, theres growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the US and UK governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called How much, how fast?, the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years.Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is really a sign of the importance of research like this, NASAs Poinar says.Given whats at stake, the research program at Thwaites isnt enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. Realistically, its probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment, says Pollard.Hes referring, of course, to the Trump administrations disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White Houses 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica.It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective, Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarcticas key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago.Hes 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight.Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought, he says. We didnt predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didnt predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after theyve happened.Theres a recurring theme throughout these scientists findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse.

b'In Tampa, the conference centers roof leaked. In Austin, the airport flooded. In Reno, conference organizers had to wait until a motorcycle rally was over before they could do some setup.During preparation for the SC Conference, a supercomputing meeting, theres always something getting in the way of networking. But the conference, held annually in November, is perhaps more sensitive to water, delays, and herds of bikes than your average gathering. Because every year, a group of volunteers shows up weeks in advance to build, from the literal ground up, the worlds fastest temporary network. The conference\'s attendees and exhibitorsfrom scientific researchers to industry bigwigsneed superfast, reliable connections to stream in the results of their simulations and data analysis. Called SCinet, the network takes one year to plan, three weeks to build, one week to operate, and less than 24 hours to tear down, according to its catchphrase.After all, what good is high-performance computing if its results cant reach the wider world?The SC Conference SeriesThis year, in Denver, one difficulty was elevationnot of the city itself, but of the exhibit hall. The 188 volunteers built up the networks\' 13 equipment racks on the floor below the big, main space, constructing the infrastructure that could eventually handle around 3.6 terabits per second of traffic. (For reference, that\'s probably around 400,000 times more powerful than your personal connection.) And then, after construction, they had to move those millions of dollars of delicate equipmentdown a hall, into an elevator, up a floor, and across the exhibit hall.On November 8, volunteers moved the equipment on customized racklifts. Welcome to the crazy, someone said, unprompted, as he rushed past. The SCinetters moved like tightrope walkers, servers in tow, toward the elevators.One floor up, a guy wearing a Scooby Doo hat pulled up with a forklift, gingerly skewered one rack, and began to lift it to the central stage. As the rack approached the platform, other volunteers put their hands on it, like digital pallbearers. When they were done, eight racks sat on the stagethe beating, blinking heart of the network. Among other duties, it coordinates with the five other racks scattered strategically around the room, ready for the exhibitors that needed 100 gigabit connections, and those requiring mere 1 or 10 gigabit hookups.https://twitter.com/Supercomputing/status/930123674471895045The demonstrations started on November 13. NASA brought out a simulation of how shockwaves from meteorites affect the atmosphereand then how their effects reach the ground, from impacts to tsunamis. Also on board: a simulation showing how person-transporting drones could work, and a global weather prediction model. The Department of Energy presented about particle accelerators, quantum computing in science, and cancer surveillance.The company Nyriad Limited, meanwhile, has aligned its stars with the International Centre of Radio Astronomy Research, to develop a "science data processing" operating system for a telescope called the Murchison Widefield Array, which itself is a precursor to the Square Kilometer Array. The Square Kilometer Array will require more computing power than any previous one: Its data rate will exceed today\'s global internet traffic. Nyriad, at the conference, revealed its first commercial offering, spun out of its SKA work: a fast and low-power storage solution useful beyond the world of astronomy.But their talks would have been all talk were it not for the homebuilt network that let them show and tell. In the weeks leading up to the actual conference, the SCinet volunteers laid 60 miles of fiber and crafted 280 WiFi access points for the nearly 13,000 attendees and their attendant devices. Oh, also, they had to have a network service provider crack up a road to illuminate a dark fiber connection.More on SupercomputersMatt SimonThe Astonishing Engineering Behind America\'s Latest, Greatest SupercomputerSarah ScolesWhy You Should Put Your Supercomputer in WyomingBrian BarrettChina\'s New Supercomputer Puts the US Even Further BehindSCinet requires lots of physical and mental labor, but people keep coming back because it\'s their brand of funand the kind of professional development they could never get at an individual institution. They get to touch and play with equipment that they normally wouldn\'t get to touch and play with in their day jobs, says Jackie Kern, former general chair of the whole conference and of SCinet. They learn new networking tricks, bring back big-kid versions of their knowledge base, and meet some of the worlds top network types. Its a Rolodex moment, says Jeffrey Schwab, current SCinet chair.Also, its summer camp for people who like to tape fiber to floors. Everyone wants to be here, says Schwab.And the organization is trying to help make it more welcoming to more different kinds of people. Kate Petersen Mace helps run the Women in IT Networking at SC program, which has fully funded 19 women volunteers\' attendance since 2015 (around 22 percent of the total number of volunteers, this year, were women). In the male-dominated networking network, that kind of professional opportunity can be rare. Mace says she has often been the only woman in a given professional space. I got kind of used to it and didnt think about it, she says. But the differences and the deficits snap into relief once there are more women in the exhibit hall (real and proverbial), watching the blinking lights on a set of server racks together alongside their male colleagues. "You feel more empowered to speak up," says Mace.A few hours after the first rack lift, Jim Stewart of the Utah Education and Telehealth Network, who co-chairs the architecture team, treks up to the exhibit hall. All of the equipment is on stage, and SCinet volunteers have installed mirrors behind it, so passersby can appreciate the effort in all dimensions. It wont last long, though. Remember the catchphrase? less than 24 hours to tear down.Stewart surveys the hall, thinking, apparently, of creation and destruction. Were not even done turning it up, and we are talking about getting out, he says.

b'Hunter Williams used to be an English teacher. Then, three years into that job, he started reading the book The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. The 1966 novel by Robert Heinlein takes place in the 2070s, on the moon, which, in this future, hosts a subterranean penal colony. Like all good sci-fi, the plot hinges on a rebellion and a computer that gains self-awareness. But more important to Williams were two basic fictional facts: First, people lived on the moon. Second, they mined the moon. I thought, This is it. This is what we really could be doing, he says.Today, that vision is closer than ever. And Williams is taking steps to make it reality. This year, he enrolled in a class called Space Resources Fundamentals, the pilot course for the first-ever academic program specializing in space mining. It\'s a good time for such an education, given that companies like Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources are planning prospecting missions, NASA\'s OSIRIS-REx is on its way to get a sample of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth, and there\'s international and commercial talk of long-term living in space.Williams had grown up with the space-farers on Star Trek, but he found Heinleins vision more credible: a colony that dug into and used the resources of their celestial body. That\'s the central tenet of the as-yet-unrealized space mining industry: You can\'t take everything with you, and, even if you can, it\'s a whole lot cheaper not toto mine water to make fuel, for instance, rather than launching it on overburdened rockets. I saw a future that wasn\'t a hundred or a thousand years away but could be happening now, says Williams.So in 2012, he adjusted trajectory and went to school for aerospace engineering. Then he worked at Cape Canaveral in Florida, doing ground support for Lockheed Martin. His building, on that cosmic coast, was right next to one of SpaceX\'s spots. Every day when I came to work, I would see testaments to new technology, he says. It was inspiring.A few years later, he still hadn\'t let go of the idea that humans could work with what they found in space. Like in his book. So he started talking to Christopher Dreyer, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines Center for Space Resources, a research and technology development center that\'s existed within the school for more than a decade.It was good timing. Because this summer, Mines announced its intention to found the worlds first graduate program in Space Resourcesthe science, technology, policy, and politics of prospecting, mining, and using those resources. The multidisciplinary program would offer Post-Baccalaureate certificates and Masters of Science degrees. Although it\'s still pending approval for a 2018 start date, the school is running its pilot course, taught by Dreyer, this semester.Williams has committed fully: He left his Canaveral job this summer and moved to Colorado to do research for Dreyer, and hopefully start the grad program in 2018.Williams wasn\'t the only one interested in the future of space mining. People from all over, non-traditional students, wanted to take Space Resources Fundamentals. And so Dreyer and Center for Space Resources director Angel Abbud-Madrid decided to run it remotely, ending up with about 15 enrollees who log in every Tuesday and Thursday night for the whole semester. Dreyer has a special setup in his office for his virtual lectures: a laptop stand, a wall of books behind him, a studio-type light that shines evenly.In the minutes before Thanskgiving-week class started, students\' heads popped up on Dreyer\'s screen as they logged in. Some are full-time students at Mines; some work in industry; some work for the government. There was the employee from the FAAs Office of Commercial Space Transportation, an office tasked, in part, with making sure the US is obeying international treaties as they explore beyond the planet. Then theres Justin Cyrus, the CEO of a startup called Lunar Outpost. Cyrus isnt mining any moons yet, but Lunar Outpost has partnered with Denvers Department of Environmental Health to deploy real-time air-quality sensors, of the kind it hopes to develop for moony use.Cyrus was a Mines graduate, with a masters in electrical and electronics engineering; he sought out Dreyer and Abbud-Madrid when he needed advice for his nascent company. When the professors announced the space resources program, Cyrus decided to get in on this pilot class. He, and the other attendees, seem to see the class not just as an educational opportunity but also as a networking one: Their classmates, they say, are the future leaders of this industry.More on Space MiningSarah ScolesAsteroid Mining Sounds Hard, Right? You Dont Know the Half of ItSarah ScolesLuxembourg\'s Bid to Become the Silicon Valley of Space MiningClive ThompsonSpace Mining Could Set Off a Star WarCyrus, the FAA employee, and Williams all smiled from their screens in front of benign backgrounds. About a dozen other studentsall menjoined in by the time class started. The day\'s lesson, about resources on the moon, came courtesy of scientist Paul Spudis, who live-broadcasted from a few states away. Spudis, a guest lecturer, showed charts and maps and data about resources the moon might harbor, and where, and their worth. He\'s bullish on the prospects of prospecting. Toward the end of his talk, he said, "I think we\'ll have commercial landings on the moon in the next year or so." Indeed, the company Moon Express is planning to land there in 2018, in a bid to win the Google Lunar X Prize.Back during Halloween week, the class covered the Outer Space Treaty, a creation of the United Nations that governs outer-space actions and (in some people\'s interpretations) makes the legality of space mining dubious. The lecture was full of policy detail, but the students drove the ensuing Q&A toward the sociological. Space mining would disproportionately help already-wealthy countries, some thought, despite talk in the broader community about how space mining lowers the barrier to space entry.In this realism, and this thoughtfulness, Dreyer\'s class is refreshing. The PR talk of big would-be space mining companies like Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries can be slick, uncomplicated, and (sometimes) unrealistic. It often skips over the many steps between here and self-sustaining space societiesnot to mention the companies\' own long-term viability.But in Space Resource Fundamentals, the students seem grounded. Student Nicholas Proctor, one of few with a non-engineering background, appreciates the  pragmatism. Proctor studied accounting as an undergrad and enrolled at Mines in mineral economics. After he received a NASA grant to study space-based solar power and its applications to the mining industry, Abbud-Madrid sent him an email telling him about the class. The professor thought it would be a good fitand Proctor obviously agreed.After Thanksgiving-week class was over, students logged off, waving one-handed goodbyes. Williams had been watching from the lab downstairs, in a high-tech warehouse-garage combo. There, he and other students work among experiments about how dust moves in space, and what asteroids are actually like. Of course, they\'re also interested in how to get stuffresourcesout of them. An old metal chamber dominates the room, looking like an unpeopled iron lung. "The big Apollo-era chamber is currently for asteroid mining," Williams explained, "breaking apart rocks with sunlight and extracting the water and even precious metals."While Williams closed up class shop downstairs, Dreyer and Abbud-Madrid hung out in Dreyer\'s office for a few minutes. Dreyer, leaning back in his well-lit chair, talked bemusedly about some of the communications they receive. We get interest from people to find out what they can mine and bring back to Earth and become a trillionaire, he said.Thats not really what the Space Resources program is about, in part because its not clear thats possibleits expensive to bring the precious (to bring anything) back to Earth. The class focusand, not coincidentally, the near-term harvestis the H2O, which will stay in space, for space-use. No matter how complex our society becomes, it always comes back to water, said Abbud-Madrid. He laughed. Were going to the moon, he continued. For water.

b'The modern human obsession with beachfront property is nothing new. For tens of thousands of years, our kind has been bonded to the coast and its bounty of food. Inland is alright, too, but nothing matches the productivity of the sea.The problem with coastal living is that while the food supply is relatively stable, sea levels are not. They\'ve always risen and fallen as the climate changes over the millenniaand thanks to the hyper-productivity of the Industrial Age, they\'re in the middle of a pretty significant uptick. In the coming decades, rising sea levels could jeopardize untold billions of dollars in real estate and infrastructure along the worlds coasts and displace millions of people.While climate change imperils humanitys future, it also imperils its past. A new study out in PLOS One quantifies that in alarming detail: Just in the southeastern United States, a sea level rise of one meter would inundate thousands of archaeological sites, from Native American settlements to early European colonies.The researchers began their archaeological accounting with what is, quite frankly, a mess of data. States are federally mandated to keep records of archaeological sites, but they dont all go about it in the same way. They might collect different kinds of information, ranging from the sorts of artifacts found to the era of settlement.So the researchers worked with an ongoing project called the Digital Index of North American Archaeology, an umbrella database that compiles this mess of data into something more manageable. Then it was a matter of marrying location data for sites in nine southeastern states, including Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, with elevation dataplotting which sites will be in trouble. (None of this location data, by the way, is particularly exact. Security purposes.)The results arent encouraging. With a sea level rise of one meterwhich could happen before the end of this centurythe states would lose over 13,000 total sites, 4,000 in Florida alone. With a rise of 5 meters, the sites lost in the region would top 32,000.Its all a bit demoralizing, I know. But this research is an attempt to bring some order to what is quickly becoming chaos. What we are hoping to get started is a conversation in American archaeology, and world archaeology," says co-author Josh Wells of Indiana University South Bend. "What are the effects of climate change on the record as we understand it, and to what extent do we need to triage and focus our efforts on recovering what we can before it\'s gone?They\'ll need to work quickly, because the scourge has already begun. This is ongoing now with sea levels slowly coming up, increased storm surges, says study co-author David Anderson of the University of Tennessee. We\'re seeing erosion of coastal archaeological sites.Its the sheer scale here thats so daunting. How do you save 13,000 individual sites? Well, you dont. Archaeologists have to face the reality that if sea levels rise, theyre going to have to pick a select few sites to concentrate on, cataloging them as best they canperhaps with slick new digital techniquesand doing whatever possible to ensure their survival.You might build a sea wall around a particularly important site, for instance, but that could endanger other sites. When you build these barriers you\'re typically taking soil, says Anderson. You\'re taking materials from locations that themselves contain archaeological and historical resources.More on climate changeMegan MolteniCould San Francisco Get the Oil Industry to Pay for Climate Change?Rebecca LeberWhat Weve Learned About Climate Change Since Hurricane SandyAnna VlasitsFour Radical Plans to Save Civilization From Climate ChangeTheoretically, you could move structures as well. The Egyptians did this with the Abu Simbel temples when a new dam threatened to submerge them in the 1960s. But what do you choose to save? Who chooses what to save? (Irony among ironies: Washington, DC and its many cultural sites may eventually be at risk, the study notes. The Lincoln Memorial sits at 10 meters above sea level, which seems like a lot until you factor in the threat of floods. So the government may need to move monuments one day, long after the man who shunned the Paris Agreement has left office.)Theres also the human cost. Archaeological sites will be submerged, but so too will modern communities. This is also already happening. In 2016, the federal government announced it would move a band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Native American tribe from coastal Louisiana, where rising waters were threatening to sweep the community away. Climate change forced them not just from their homes, but historically and culturally significant locations.Relocations, though, can further complicate matters. As sea levels rise, more and more people will have to move inland. And development there could imperil the archaeological sites that would otherwise survive sea level rise.Yeah, it\'s scary stuff. But this research is a big step toward making sea level rise not only more comprehensible, but manageable. After all, we\'ve got a future to safeguard and a past to preserve.

It was a weeklets get you caught up.HeadlinesStories you might have missed from WIRED this weekLast February, Google's self-driving car spinoff dropped an explosive lawsuit against Uber, alleging trade secret theft, conspiracy, and general engineering malfeasance in the pursuit of a fully operational autonomous vehicle. The case against Uber just got even more explode-y. Less than a week before the trial was set to begin, a new piece of evidence emerged, a letter written by the lawyer of a former Uber employee. He says the ridehailing company used ephemeral messaging apps like Wickr to communicate, and dedicated an entire unit to swiping the competition trade secrets. Uber ended up paying the employee, a risk analyst named Ric Jacobs, $4.5 million in settlement and consulting feesand didnt hand over the letter to the Waymo legal team during discovery. Uber says theres good reason for that; the judge is skeptical. Now the trial is delayed until February and Waymo gets another chance to paw through Ubers documents.

b'The rules of Tinder are pretty simple: You swipe right, or you swipe left. You like someone\'s profile (right), or you don\'t (left). Occasionally, you might send a Super Likethe digital version of showing up at someone\'s doorstep, bouquet of flowers in hand, blasting "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer out of a boomboxbut otherwise, there\'s not much nuance. The Tinderverse exists in black and white.But those simple decisions translate into a lot of data. Every time you swipe right, Tinder learns a clue about what you look for in a potential match. The more you swipe, the closer Tinder becomes to piecing together the mosaic of your dating preferences. As millions of people spend hours flicking their thumbs across their screens, Tinder\'s data scientists are carefully watching.Today, the company puts some of that data to use with a new feature called Super Likeable, which uses machine learning to predict which profiles youre most likely to swipe right on. Those profiles will pop up periodically in groups of four, and users will be able to send one of them a bonus Super Like. (Yes, you have to send a Super Like. Tinder claims that doing so "increases your likelihood of matching by three times," though some people would argue that Super Likes seem a little desperate.)More on TinderAlana Hope LevinsonCan Women Build A Better Tinder?Elizabeth StinsonThis Robot Is Better at Tinder Than YouJon MooallemSorry, But if You\'re Married, Browsing Tinder Totally Makes You a SnakeSuper Likeable builds on a machine learning tool called TinVec, which Tinder announced earlier this month at the Machine Learning Conference in San Francisco. The proprietary tool sifts through vast amounts of swiping data to find patternslike your tendency to dig men with beardsand then searches for new profiles that fit those patterns. Tinder then adds those profiles to your swiping queue. The more you swipe, the sharper the predictions become, and (theoretically, at least) the more likely you are to swipe right on the profiles Tinder expects you will.Tinder won\'t explain exactly how its algorithms work, but Brian Norgard, Tinders chief product officer, says Super Likeable synthesizes all kinds of data from a user\'s past swipes to predict future matches. TinVec relies on users past swiping behavior, but that swiping behavior takes into account multiple factors, both physical and otherwise, Norgard says. The beauty of AI is that it incorporates all of those inputs into its ranking system.Dating GamesTinder already uses machine learning to fine-tune other aspects of the matchmaking process. Last year, it introduced a feature called Smart Photos, which prioritizes users profile pictures based on which one is most likely to earn a right swipe. It also developed Smart Profiles to surface things in common, like a shared hometown or a mutual interest in videogames.Tinder\'s greatest asset in developing these kinds of algorithms may be the overwhelming amount of data the app collects from its massive user base. There are roughly 26 million matches on Tinder every day. That adds up to over 20 billion matches made since Tinder launched five years ago. Using all that information on who likes who, Tinder says its TinVec algorithms can accurately predict who you\'ll like next with shocking accuracy. In other words: Tinder knows who you\'ll swipe right on long before you ever see the person\'s profile in the app.The idea behind Super Likeable is to surface these profiles faster. From a user\'s perspective, that should get you closer to swiping right on the people you actually like more often. But Super Likeable also provides a way for Tinder to better train its matching algorithms. Heres a batch of profiles that Tinder predicted youd be most likely to swipe right on. Whether you do or not is a way for Tinder to check if its getting the equation right, and then adjust its algorithms accordingly.For now, Tinders only rolling out Super Likeable to users in Los Angeles and New York. And since Tinder needs enough swiping data to curate recommendations, not everyone will see a Super Likeable box right away. "The more a user swipes, the better our recommendations will be, so there is a threshold before a user will see a Super Likeable card," he says. When a Super Likeable box does pop up, it\'ll always offer four profiles and one Super Like.Hot or NotIn some ways, the feature seems to further reduce the matching process to criteria on a checklist, resurfacing the same "types" that people already know they like: men with beards, or women who wear glasses. Algorithms are good at finding the profiles that include photos of beards or glasses, and not so good at determining human chemistry.Norgard says it\'s not quite so simple. Sometimes people may think they want one thing, but then when they see something totally different that interests them, it helps them realize that their original filtering criteria might not have been entirely accurate, he says. The beauty of our swiping-based algorithms is that peoples actions tend to be true to what they really want, not what they think they want."Either way, Super Likeable promises to be the next step in Tinder\'s quest to understand exactly which type of people you\'ll swipe right on. As the app collects more and more data about your swiping behavior, it will curate more and more recommendationsuntil someday, maybe, Tinder will know exactly who you\'ll date long before you do.' 

b"Executives at ascendant tech titans like Amazon and Google tend to look down on their predecessor IBM. The fading giant of Armonk, New York, once sustained itself inventing and selling cutting-edge technology, but now leans heavily on consulting. Renting out people to help other companies with tech projects is a messier and less scalable business than selling computing power on a distant cloud server, and leaving the customer to do the grunt work.Yet as Amazon and Google seek greater riches by infusing the world with artificial intelligence, theyve started their own consulting operations, lending out some of their prized AI talent to customers. The reason: Those other businesses lack the expertise to take advantage of techniques such as machine learning.Many companies use cloud platforms for tasks like data storage or powering websites and mobile apps. Market leader Amazon and its rivals are now trying to convince their customers to also buy AI services to mine insights from the hordes of data they amass. But AI experts are in short supply, in no small part because big tech companies compete fiercely to hire them.Amazon launched several new cloud services for tasks such as understanding audio and training machine-learning models at its AWS re:Invent cloud conference in Las Vegas this week. An executive from the NFL came onstage Wednesday to boast how the league tapped Amazons machine-learning tools to determine how far players run, and how fast they accelerate.But the NFL couldnt do that work itself. It got hands-on help from Amazons elite machine-learning experts through a new consulting operation called AWS Solutions Lab. Lab staffers examine a companys data and systems, brainstorm ideas for how to improve them using AI, and help implement the plans.AWS made its first big push into AI services last year. Swami Sivasubramanian, who leads AI initiatives at AWS, says the consulting shop was launched in response to  requests from customers for help building AI systems. We consistently heard they wanted to learn from the machine-learning scientists who built these capabilities for Amazon.com, he says. Companies pay to tap Amazons experts, but Sivasubramanian declined to detail the menu they are offered or the prices, saying it varies depending on the project.Google launched its own consulting AI shop late last year. The Machine Learning Advanced Solutions Lab, as it is called, lets customers such as insurer USAA work on  projects with Google AI engineers at a dedicated facility at the companys campus in Mountain View, California. It also offers a four-week training program to help customers engineers improve their AI chops.Related StoriesCade MetzSundar Pichai Sees Google's Future in the Smartest CloudKlint FinleyAfter Slurping Up AI Researchers, Facebook Offers to ShareTom SimoniteMeet the High Schooler Shaking Up Artificial IntelligenceThat such prized and well-compensated employees are now being put to work for others suggests that selling AI is more complex than executive keynotes imply. The gating factor is people dont know how to do this stuff, says Rob Koplowitz, who tracks cloud AI for Forrester. There needs to be some hand-holding here in the early stages.The hand-holding stage may continue for a while. Amazons Sivasubramanian believes it will take a few years before machine-learning expertise is as widely shared as knowledge of distributed systems, the practice of using networked computers to solve problems at the heart of cloud computing.Google CEO Sundar Pichai said this fall that there are only a few thousands of people capable of creating sophisticated machine-learning models. He has a team trying to make machine-learning software create machine-learning software, but its so far just a research project.The expertise shortage upsets the usual dynamic of the cloud market, where Amazon, Google, and others mostly compete on price and technical features. If youre a random manufacturing company in the midwest you may have money, but its hard to attract a $250,000-a-year Stanford PhD to work for you, says Diego Oppenheimer, whose Google-backed startup provides tools that help companies deploy machine-learning software. Companies in that situation may be more swayed by an offer of help building AI, than pricing and performance, he says.Cloud companies have made AI more accessible. Amazon launched a new service that transcribes speech from audio or video this week, for example. A company that wants to transcribe meetings or calls can very easily ship off files to Amazons servers and get text back. Amazon and Google both offer services that identify common objects and scenes in photos.The most powerful use cases for AI arent one-size-fits-all. Machine learning software typically is trained to solve a very specific problem. If I need to figure out how much rust is on my industrial boiler, a cat and dog recognizer is not going to help, says Chris Nicholson, CEO and cofounder of Skymind, which sells machine-learning tools and has helped organizations including the Department of Homeland Security use them in machine learning projects. Nicholson says that by creating consulting services, Amazon and Google basically showed the Achilles heel of their business model.A Microsoft vice president said at a conference this spring that many cloud AI systems are too complex for many companies to reap the same benefits from machine learning as big tech companies. Microsoft is trying to help customers for its AI services with a suite of online courses marketed as AI School. It was part of a $102 million investment round this summer into Element AI, a startup that will offer AI consulting services.Amazon launched its own education initiative this week. A new $250 camera called DeepLens is designed to give developers an easy way to learn about machine learningand Amazon services. Carnegie Mellon University plans to use the device with students, and other colleges are expected to do the same.Many attendees of Amazons conference this week are getting a DeepLens for free. Some started hacking with the device on Wednesday. Sivasubramanian says people with little or no experience with machine learning were soon building copies of the Hotdog detector from the TV show Silicon Valley, or apps that use object and face recognition. Were going to make machine learning a normal part of programming, he says. Until it is, expect to see leading cloud companies aping IBM.

b'It\'s almost always the last topic in the first semester of introductory physicsangular momentum. Best for last, or something? I\'ve used this concept to describe everything from fidget spinners to standing double back flips to the movement of strange interstellar asteroids.But really, what the heck is angular momentum?Let me start with the following situation. Imagine that there are two balls in space connected by a spring. Why are there two balls in space? I don\'t knowjust use your imagination.Not only are these balls connected by a spring, but the red ball has a mass that is three times the mass of the yellow balljust for fun.  Now the two balls are pushed such that they move around each otherjust like this.Yes, this is a numerical calculation. If you want to take a look at the code and play with it yourself (and you should), here it is. If you want all the details about how to make something like this, take a look at this post on the three body problem.When we see stuff like these rotating spring-balls, we think about what is conservedwhat doesn\'t change. Momentum is a good example of a conserved quantity. We can define momentum as:Let me just make a plot of the total momentum as a function of time for this spring-ball system. Since momentum is a vector, I will have to plot one component of the momentumjust for fun, I will choose the x-coordinate. Here\'s what I get.In that plot, the red curve is the x-momentum of the red (heavier) ball and the blue curve is for the yellow ball (yellow doesn\'t show up in the graph very well). The black line is the total momentum. Notice that as one object increases in momentum, the other object decreases. Momentum is conserved. You could do the same thing in the y-direction or the z-direction, but I think you get the idea.What about energy?  I can calculate two types of energy for this system consisting of the balls and the spring. There is kinetic energy and there is a spring potential energy:The kinetic energy depends on the mass (m) and velocity (v) of the objects where the potential energy is related to the stiffness of the spring (k) and the stretch (s). Now I can plot the total energy of this system. Note that energy is a scalar quantity, so I don\'t have to plot just one component of it.The black curve is again the total energy. Notice that it is constant. Energy is also conserved.But is there another conserved quantity that could be calculated? Is the angular velocity conserved? Clearly it is not. As the balls come closer together, they seem to spin faster. How about a quick check, using a plot of the angular velocity as a function of time.Nope: Clearly, this is not conserved. I could plot the angular velocity of each ballbut they would just have the same value and not add up to a constant.OK, but there is something else that can be calculated that will perhaps be conserved. You guessed it: It\'s called the angular momentum. The angular momentum of a single particle depends on both the momentum of that particle and its vector location from some point. The angular momentum can be calculated as:Although this seems like a simple expression, there is much to go over.  First, the L vector represents the angular momentumyes, it\'s a vector. Second, the r vector is a distance vector from some point to the object and finally the p vector represents the momentum (product of mass and velocity). But what about that "X"? That is the cross product operator. The cross product is an operation between two vectors that produces a vector result (because you can\'t use scalar multiplication between two vectors).I don\'t want to go into a bunch of maths regarding the cross product, so instead I will just show it to you.  Here is a quick python program showing two vectors (A and B) as well as  A x B (you would say that as A cross B).You can click and drag the yellow A vector around and see what happens to the resultant of A x B.  Also, don\'t forget that you can always look at the code by clicking the "pencil" icon and then click the "play" to run it. Notice that A X B is always perpendicular to both A and Bthus this is always a three-dimensional problem. Oh, you can also rotate the vectors by using the right-click or ctrl-click and drag.But now I can calculate (and plot) the total angular momentum of this ball-spring system. Actually, I can\'t plot the angular momentum since that\'s a vector. Instead I will plot the z-component of the angular momentum. Also, I need to pick a point about which to calculate the angular momentum. I will use the center of mass for the ball-spring system.There are some important things to notice in this plot. First, both the balls have constant z-component of angular momentum so of course the total angular momentum is also constant. Second, the z-component of angular momentum is negative. This means the angular momentum vector is pointing in a direction that would appear to be into the screen (from your view).So it appears that this quantity called angular momentum is indeed conserved. If you want, you can check that the angular momentum is also conserved in the x and y-directions (but it is).But wait! you say. Maybe angular momentum is only conserved because I am calculating it with respect to the center of mass for the ball-spring system. OK, fine. Let\'s move this point to somewhere else such that the momentum vectors will be the same, but now the r-vectors for the two balls will be something different. Here\'s what I get for the z-component of angular momentum.Now you can see that the z-component for the two balls both individually change, but the total angular momentum is constant.  So angular momentum is still conserved.  In the end, angular momentum is something that is conserved for situations that have no external torque like these spring balls. But why do we even need angular momentum? In this case, we really don\'t need it. It is quite simple to model the motion of the objects just using the momentum principle and forces (which is how I made the python model you see).But what about something else? Take a look at this quick experiment. There is a rotating platform with another disk attached to a motor.\nWhat happens with the motor-disk starts to spin? Watch. (There\'s a YouTube version here.)Again, angular momentum is conserved. As the motor disk starts to spin one way, the rest of the platform spins the other way such that the total angular momentum is constant (and zero in this case). For a situation like this, it would be pretty darn difficult to model this situation with just forces and momentum. Oh, you could indeed do itbut you would have to consider both the platform and the disk as many, many small masses each with different momentum vectors and position vectors. It would be pretty much impossible to explain with that method. However, by using angular momentum for these rigid objects, it\'s not such a bad physics problem.In the end, angular momentum is yet another thing that we can calculateand it turns out to be useful in quite a number of situations. If you can find some other quantity that is conserved in different situations, you will probably be famous. You can also name the quantity after yourself if that makes you happy.

b'In 1891, a New York doctor named William B. Coley injected a mixture of beef broth and Streptococcus bacteria into the arm of a 40-year-old Italian man with an inoperable neck tumor. The patient got terribly sickdeveloping a fever, chills, and vomiting. But a month later, his cancer had shrunk drastically. Coley would go on to repeat the procedure in more than a thousand patients, with wildly varying degrees of success, before the US Food and Drug Administration shut him down.Coleys experiments were the first forays into a field of cancer research known today as immunotherapy. Since his first experiments, the oncology world has mostly moved on to radiation and chemo treatments. But for more than a century, immunotherapywhich encompasses a range of treatments designed to supercharge or reprogram a patients immune system to kill cancer cellshas persisted, mostly around the margins of medicine. In the last few years, though, an explosion of tantalizing clinical results have reinvigorated the field and plunged investors and pharma execs into a spending spree.Though he didnt have the molecular tools to understand why it worked, Coleys forced infections put the bodys immune system into overdrive, allowing it to take out cancer cells along the way. While the FDA doesnt have a formal definition for more modern immunotherapies, in the last few years it has approved at least eight drugs that fit the bill, unleashing a flood of money to finance new clinical trials. (Patients had better come with floods of money tooprices can now routinely top six figures.)But while the drugs are dramatically improving the odds of survival for some patients, much of the basic science is still poorly understood. And a growing number of researchers worry that the sprint to the clinic offers cancer patients more hype than hope.When immunotherapy works, it really works. But not for every kind of cancer, and not for every patientnot even, it turns out, for the majority of them. The reality is immunotherapy is incredibly valuable for the people who can actually benefit from it, but there are far more people out there who dont benefit at all, says Vinay Prasad, an Oregon Health and Science University oncologist.Prasad has come to be regarded as a professional cancer care critic, thanks to his bellicose Twitter style and John Arnold Foundation-backed crusade against medical practices he says are based on belief, not scientific evidence. Using national cancer statistics and FDA approval records, Prasad recently estimated the portion of all patients dying from all types of cancer in America this year who might actually benefit from immunotherapy. The results were disappointing: not even 10 percent.Now, thats probably a bit of an understatement. Prasad was only looking at the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs in a field that is rapidly expanding. Called checkpoint inhibitors, they work by disrupting the immune systems natural mechanism for reining in T cells, blood-borne sentinels that bind and kill diseased cells throughout the body. The immune cells are turned off most of the time, thanks to proteins that latch on to a handful of receptors on their surface. But scientists designed antibodies to bind to those same receptors, knocking out the regulatory protein and keeping the cells permanently switched to attack mode.The first checkpoint inhibitors just turned T cells on. But some of the newer ones can work more selectively, using the same principle to jam a signal that tumors use to evade T cells. So far, checkpoint inhibitors have shown near-miraculous results for a few rare, previously incurable cancers like Hodgkins lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The drugs are only approved to treat those conditions, leaving about two-thirds of terminal cancer patients without an approved immunotherapy option.But Prasad says that isnt stopping physicians from prescribing the drugs anyway.Hype has encouraged rampant off-label use of checkpoint inhibitors as a last-ditch effort, he sayseven for patients with tumors that show no evidence theyll respond to the drugs. The antibodies are available off the shelf, but at a list price near $150,000 per year, its an investment Prasad says doctors shouldnt encourage lightly. Especially when theres no reliable way of predicting who will respond and who wont. This thwarts one of the goals of cancer care," says Prasad. "When you run out of helpful responses, how do you help a patient navigate what it means to die well?Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb have dominated this first wave of immunotherapy, selling almost $9 billion worth of checkpoint inhibitors since they went on sale in 2015. Roche, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Abbvie, and Regeneron have all since jumped in the game, spending billions on acquiring biotech startups and beefing up in-house pipelines. And 800 clinical trials involving a checkpoint inhibitor are currently underway in the US, compared with about 200 in 2015. This is not sustainable, Genentech VP of cancer immunology Ira Mellman told the audience at last years annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer. With so many trials, he said, the industry was throwing every checkpoint inhibitor combination at the wall just to see what would stick.After more than a decade stretching out the promise of checkpoint inhibitors, patientsand businesseswere ready for something new. And this year, they got it: CAR T cell therapy. The immunotherapy involves extracting a patients T cells and genetically rewiring them so they can more efficiently home in on tumors in the bodytraining a foot soldier as an assassin that can slip behind enemy lines.In September, the FDA cleared the first CAR-T therapya treatment for children with advanced leukemia, developed by Novartiswhich made history as the first-ever gene therapy approved for market. A month later the agency approved another live cell treatment, developed by Kite Pharma, for a form of adult lymphoma. In trials for the lymphoma drug, 50 percent of patients saw their cancer disappear completely, and stay gone.More on Gene TherapyMegan MolteniScientists Save a Kid By Growing a Whole New Skin For HimCarl ZimmerGene Therapy Emerges From Disgrace to Be the Next Big Thing, AgainNick StocktonHow Crispr Could Snip Away Some of Humanity\'s Worst DiseasesKites ascendance in particular is a stunning indicator of how much money CAR-T therapy has attracted, and how fast. The company staged a $128 million IPO in 2014when it had only a single late-phase clinical trial to its nameand sold to Gilead Science in August for $11.9 billion. For some context, consider that when Pfizer bought cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion last yearone of the biggest pharma deals of 2016the company already had an FDA-approved blockbuster tumor-fighter on the market with $2 billion in annual sales, plus two late-stage candidates in the pipeline.While Kite and Novartis were the only companies to actually launch products in 2017, more than 40 other pharma firms and startups are currently building pipelines. Chief rival Juno Therapeutics went public with a massive $265 million initial offeringthe largest biotech IPO of 2014before forming a $1 billion partnership with Celgene in 2015. In the last few years, at least half a dozen other companies have made similar up-front deals worth hundreds of millions.These treatments will make up just a tiny slice of the $107 billion cancer drug market. Only about 600 people a year, for example, could benefit from Novartis flagship CAR-T therapy. But the company set the price for a full course of treatment at a whopping $475,000. So despite the small clientele, the potential payoff is hugeand the technology is attracting a lot of investor interest. CAR-T venture financing is still a small piece of total venture funding in oncology, but given that these therapies are curative for a majority of patients that have received them in clinical trials, the investment would appear to be justified, says Mandy Jackson, a managing editor for research firm Informa Pharma Intelligence.CAR-T, with its combination of gene and cell therapies, may be the most radical anticancer treatment ever to arrive in clinics. But the bleeding edge of biology can be a dangerous place for patients.Sometimes, the modified T cells go overboard, excreting huge quantities of molecules called cytokines that lead to severe fevers, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. In some patients it gets even worse. Sometimes the blood-brain barrier inexplicably breaks downand the T cells and their cytokines get inside patients skulls. Last year, Juno pulled the plug on its lead clinical trial after five leukemia patients died from massive brain swelling. Other patients have died in CAR-T trials at the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania.Scientists dont fully understand why some CAR-T patients experience cytokine storms and neurotoxicity and others come out cured. Its kind of like the equivalent of getting on a Wright Brothers airplane as opposed to walking on a 747 today, says Wendell Lim, a biophysical chemist and director of the UC San Francisco Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology. To go from bumping along at a few hundred feet to cruise control at Mach 0.85 will mean equipping T cells with cancer-sensing receptors that are more specific than the current offerings.Take the two FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies, he says. They both treat blood cancers in which immune responders called B cells become malignant and spread throughout the body. Doctors reprogram patients T cells to seek out a B cell receptor called CD-19. When they find it, they latch on and shoot it full of toxins. Thing is, the reprogrammed T cells cant really tell the difference between cancerous B cells and normal ones. The therapy just takes them all out. Now, you can live without B cells if you receive antibody injections to compensateso the treatment works out fine most of the time.But solid tumors are trickiertheyre made up of a mix of cells with different genetic profiles. Scientists have to figure out which tumor cells matter to the growth of the cancer and which ones dont. Then they have to design T cells with antigens that can target just those ones and nothing else. An ideal signature would involve two to three antigens that your assassin T cells can use to pinpoint the target with a bullet instead of a grenade.Last year Lim launched a startup called Cell Design Labs to try to do just that, as well as creating a molecular on-off-switch to make treatments more controlled. Only if researchers can gain this type of precise command, says Lim, will CAR-T treatments become as safe and predictable as commercial airline flight.The field has matured considerably since Coley first shot his dying patient full of a dangerous bacteria, crossed his fingers, and hoped for the best. Sure, the guy lived, even making a miraculous full recovery. But many after him didnt. And that fingers crossed approach still lingers over immunotherapy today.All these years later, the immune system remains a fickle ally in the war on cancer. Keeping the good guys from going double-agent is going to take a lot more science. But at least the revolution will be well-financed.

b'For the first time, humans have detected an interstellar asteroida space rock they\'re calling \'Oumuamua, which is a Hawaiian word meaning "scout." It\'s the only object we\'ve ever seen that entered the solar system from beyond our little collection of planets. That\'s a pretty big deal on its own. But on top of that, this asteroid has a really interesting shape: It\'s very long and skinny, with a width to length ratio of about 1 to 10.Basically, it looks like a cigaror at least that\'s what everyone is saying. The only images we have that show its shape in detail are artistic renderings. Because the asteroid is so relatively small and far away, you can\'t easily see it with a visible-light telescope.But if you can\'t see it, how can you describe it? The answer to this (as in many situations in science) is to use indirect observations. The one thing that can be measured is the brightness of the object. Because this rock is also spinning, the light it reflects from the sun changes over time. By looking at the ratio of the brightest to weakest observations, you can get an estimate of largest to smallest size. If you estimate the albedo (a measure of reflectance), you can also estimate the total size.  Boom. There you have ita cigar-shaped asteroid.If you want to learn the answers to more "how do you know"-type questions about \'Oumuamua, check out this awesome NASA FAQ. But if you want to calculate some answers for yourselfwell, just keep reading.Could this be a spacecraft?OK, everyone calm down. This isn\'t a page from Rendezvous with Ramaan Arthur C. Clarke novel that depicts an interstellar object that happens to be an alien starship. But what if it was a spaceship? Could its rotation make a type of artificial gravity?From the data, we know the following two important things about \'Oumuamua: the length and the rotation rate. OK, we don\'t actually know the length, but it\'s somewhere between 200 and 400 meters. I\'m going to use the bigger size. The rotation rate is known with more precision as it rotates once every 8.1 hours.How would this make artificial gravity? Let me start with a diagram.When this "spacecraft" is far away from a star or other massive objects, there is essentially no gravitational force acting on people inside. You can make fake gravity by spinning the spacecraft (as shown above). This spinning motion creates a force (labeled F above) that reproduces the effect of the floor pushing on you to counteract gravity. This force from the floor is what we feel on Earth. If you want a longer explanation, check out my older post about weight and weightlessness.But why is there a force between the human (or maybe an alien) and the end of the rotating asteroid?  It\'s because the human is moving in a circle. In order to move in a circular motion, you need a force pointing towards the center of the circle. We often call this a centripetal force which means "center pointing force." The magnitude of this force depends on the mass of the object, the size of the circle and the rotation rate ().Of course, different humans of different masses will have different forcesjust like on Earth. So really it\'s just the acceleration that matters for artificial gravity; that\'s just the product of  squared and the radius. If you get an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2, then you have successfully reproduced Earth-like gravity (but not really gravityjust apparent weight).Now for the acceleration of the end of \'Oumuamua (it\'s sort of fun to say that out loud after you get used to it). This rock has a circular radius of 200 meters (I\'m using the biggest value), but what about the angular velocity? Since it takes 8.1 hours for one rotation,  would be 2 times  divided by 8.1 hours. Of course I really need this time in seconds, so that gives me:Yes, that\'s a pretty slow rotation rate. Just for comparison, it takes the Earth about 24 hours to rotate. Now I can put this along with the radius to calculate the acceleration. This gives a centripetal acceleration of 9.3 x 10-6 m/s2 or an apparent weight that is just 9.48 x 10-7 of that on Earthin other words, it\'s super tiny.There, I just did the first homework question for you.  Now for some more. Note, some of these might require some complex calculations and estimationsthat\'s what makes them fun.HomeworkHow fast would this asteroid need to rotate such that people inside would experience an apparent weight half that of on Earth? Note: Here are some rotating space craft from science fictionjust for fun.If a human was standing inside this asteroid (that\'s actually a spacecraft), could that human jump from one side of the ship to the other?Assume \'Oumuamua has a uniform density like a rock (you pick your favorite rock). How much energy would it take to get it rotating at the current angular velocity?If you are standing at one end of the rotating spaceship, how fast would you have to throw a baseball such that it makes it to the other side without hitting the wall?  Hint: Think about the Coriolis force. You might need to make a numerical model, but you could probably do this with a rough estimation.Create a Python model showing the rotating \'Oumuamua as it moves through the solar system. You can model the solar system as just the sun and Jupiter.Suppose we want to rendezvous with \'Oumuamuawhich would be a cool title for a book. How fast would the spacecraft from Earth have to travel in order to catch up with \'Oumuamua before it leaves the solar system? How long would this trip take? This one is difficult.Super large asteroids are spherical, but this one is not.  Calculate the net gravitational force on a part of the asteroid to show that it is much smaller than the bonding forces of a typical rock.As \'Oumuamua moves past the sun, it has two types of angular momentum. There is the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum.  I believe (but I\'m not 100 percent sure) that the total angular momentum of spin plus orbit should be constant. Estimate the change in spin angular momentum as it passes the sun (due to tidal gravitational forces). Should this change the orbital angular momentum?Why is this asteroid so skinny? Make up a plausible story to explain its shape.' 

b'"Nadie te quita lo bailado. (No one can take from you what youve danced.)For Federico Ardila, this Latin American expression epitomizes his approach to life and mathematics. Its the driving force behind the parties he DJs in venues across the San Francisco Bay Area, where people dance till morning to the beats of his native Colombia. The dance floor is a place where you have your freedom and you have your power, and nobody can take that away from you, Ardila said.Quanta MagazineAboutOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.\nHe taught the expression to his students at San Francisco State University, where he is a math professor, after giving them a punishingly hard exam. San Francisco State has a highly diverse student body, and Ardila, who just turned 40, is a prominent voice in the mathematics community about how to make students from underrepresented groups such as women and people of colorfeel that they belong. But on this occasion, as he looked around at his students demoralized faces, he knew he had missed the mark.Nadie te quita lo bailado, Ardila told his students.I think thats a very powerful messagethat nobody can take away from you the joy that youve had doing mathematics, he told Quanta Magazine in an interview last month. And people can give you grades, but thats not going to take away the freedom that you felt and the fulfillment that you felt.The expression also applies to Ardilas research, though not always in ways he would have chosen. Four years ago in Portland, Oregon, a thief smashed his car window and made off with a backpack containing, as luck would have it, five years worth of workall of Ardilas notes from a sweeping new paper he was developing. Proofs, examples, counterexamples and conjectures were all gone.But the thief couldnt steal the mathematics Ardila had danced in his mind. Over the past few years, Ardila and his coauthor, Marcelo Aguiar of Cornell University, have painstakingly reconstructed their work unifying the geometric and algebraic sides of combinatoricsthe study of discrete structures like a social network, a sudoku puzzle, or a phylogenetic tree. They finally posted their 113-page paper online in September, and in January Ardila will be presenting their work in an invited address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the biggest annual math conference in the United States.Quanta spoke with Ardila at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, where he is visiting for the fall semester, about the mathematics he has danced and taught. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Your mathematical talent was identified quite earlyin fourth grade, you got the highest score in your age group in a national math competition in Colombia.It was actually my sister, Natalia, who first showed great promise in mathematics. I was just the little brother. She and my cousin Ana Mara, they both performed really, really well in this national math competition. And I think the organizers probably said, OK, these two women are very good, and then heres the little brother whos coming along to the awards ceremony. Maybe hes OK also.I feel like from a young age, they were paying attention to me. I never enjoyed mathematics in school very much, but my experience through the Math Olympics was much more creative and much more playful.Federico Ardila as a child in Colombia with his mother, Amparo, and his sister, Natalia.Jorge E. ArdilaAnd it turned out that it was, as many of these spaces are, a very male-dominated space, and eventually both my sister and my cousin felt uncomfortable with this space. I mean, theyre doing amazing things now; my cousin is an engineer and my sister is a music pedagogy professor. But I do think its kind of interestingthat was a space where I felt very comfortable and that felt very nurturing to me, and it didnt feel so to other people. It was a space that was very othering for them. I think thats always served to remind me of the role of a mathematician, of an educator, in curating the culture of a place. Thats why thats been such a theme in my work.Youve said that you were surprised to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where you did your undergraduate and doctoral studies. Whats the story there?I had never heard of MIT. And it hadnt crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and apply.At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not like being told, Read this or Think this way. I just kind of wanted to do things on my own terms.I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have applied with that kind of transcript.I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that were not eligible or that were not good enough. And especially if youre somebody who feels othered in your discipline or who feels like youre lacking confidence, its easy to close doors on yourself. Theres a lot of people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you cant do it for yourself.When you came to the United States, as an undergraduate at MIT, it was your turn to feel like the other.Its not that anybody did anything to mistreat me or to doubt me or to explicitly make me feel unwelcome, but I definitely felt very different. I mean, my mathematical education was outstanding and I had fantastic access to professors and really interesting material, but I only realized in retrospect that I was extremely isolated.Theres a system in place that makes certain people comfortable and others uncomfortable, I think just by the nature of whos in the space. And I say that without wanting to point fingers, because I think you can be critical about the spaces that other you, but you also have to be critical about the ways in which you other other people.I think because mathematics sees itself as very objective, we think we can just say, Well, logically, this seems to make sense that were doing everything correctly. I think sometimes were a little bit oblivious as to what is the culture of a place, or who feels welcome, or what are we doing to make them feel welcome?So when I try to create mathematical spaces, I try to be very mindful of letting people be their full human selves. And I hope that will give people more access to tools and opportunities.What are some of the ways you do that in your teaching?In a classroom Im the professor, and so in some sense Im the culture keeper. And one thing that I try to doand its a little bit scary and its not easyis to really try to shift the power dynamic and make sure that students feel like equally powerful contributors to the place. I try to create spaces where were kind of together constructing a mathematical reality.So, for example, I taught a combinatorics class, and in every single class every single student did something active and communicated their mathematical ideas to somebody else. The structure of the class was such that they couldnt just sit there and be passive.I believe in the power of music, and so I got each one of them to play a song for the rest for us at the beginning of each class. At the beginning it felt like this wild experiment where I didnt know what was going to happen, but I was really moved by their responses.Some of them would dedicate the song to their mom and talk about how whenever theyre studying math, theyre very aware that their mom worked incredibly hard to give them the opportunity to be the first ones in their family to go to college. Another student played this song in Arabic called Freedom. And she was talking about how in this day and age its very difficult for her to feel at home and welcome and free in this country, and how mathematics for her is a place where nobody can take her freedom away.That classroom felt like no other classroom that Ive ever taught in. It was a very human experience, and it was one of the richest math classrooms that Ive had. I think one worries when you do that, Are you covering enough mathematics? But when students are engaged so actively and when you really listen to their ideas, then magic happens that you couldnt have done by preparing a class and just delivering it.Mathematics has this stereotype of being an emotionless subject, but you describe it in very emotional termsfor instance, in course curricula you promise your students a joyful experience.I think doing mathematics is tremendously emotional, and I think that anybody who does mathematics knows this. I just dont think that we have the emotional awareness or vocabulary to talk about this as a community. But you walk around this building and people are making these discoveries, and there are so many emotions going ona lot of frustration and a lot of joy.I think one thing that happens is we dont acknowledge this as a culturebecause mathematics is emotional in sometimes very difficult ways. It can really make you feel very bad about yourself sometimes. You can be pushing on something for six months and then have it collapse, and that hurts. I dont think we talk about that hurt enough. And the joy of discovering something after six months of working on it is really deep.Your own research is in combinatorics. And the paper youll be presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings connects two different ways of understanding combinatorial structures, through the lenses of geometry and algebra. How do those two approaches work?When you look at the geometric side of things, suppose, for example, you want to study the permutations (the ways of rearranging a collection of objects). Its pretty well known that if you have n objects, the number of ways of putting them in a row is n factorial (the product n(n-1)(n-2)1). So its not a very interesting problem to count how many ways there are. But what is their inherent structure?The three-dimensional permutahedron, a geometric depiction of the ways to rearrange the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Two permutations are connected by an edge if one can be transformed into the other by swapping two consecutive numbers.Tilman PieskIf you look at when two permutations are related to each other by just swapping two elements, then you start understanding not only how many there are but how are they related to each other. And then, when you say, OK, lets take all the permutations, and put an edge between two of them if theyre a swap away, then you find that you get this beautiful shape thats a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides). I think its completely surprising initially that the inherent relations between permutations are captured in this beautiful polytope called a permutahedron. So all of a sudden you have this geometric model, and you can use tools from polytope theory to try to say new things about permutations. And that polytope has existed for a long time and is very well understood.And then you can also think of permutations algebraicallytheres a natural sort of multiplication on permutations, in which the product of two permutations is the permutation you get by doing one permutation after the other.This is one of the most important objects in algebra, this group of permutations.More QuantaKevin HartnettThe Mathematician Who Will Make You Fall in Love With NumbersErica KlarreichUnknown Mathematician Proves Elusive Property of Prime NumbersErica KlarreichMeet the Guy Who Sorts All the World\'s Numbers in His AtticThere are these two traditions, to take combinatorial objects and either make them geometric or make them algebraic. This project with Marcelo Aguiar was about trying to bring together these two points of view, and in fact we discovered that polytopes like the permutahedra have an additional related algebraic structure. I think we found a really beautiful connection between the geometric and the algebraic structure of combinatorial objects. We got a dozen results just from building this architecture and then reaping the benefits.For many, though by no means all, mathematicians, teaching takes a back seat to research. But for you, it seems that teaching and research are very much intertwined. You often give your students open-ended problems, and youve co-authored many papers with students.I love working with students. And I love sharing the joy of discovery with them. Most of my students are masters and undergrad students, because San Francisco State doesnt have a PhD program. I think that has steered my research to things that are more immediately accessible. But still, I need the questions to be very deep.Im very excited about my research. I think Im doing the most interesting research of my life right now. People tell you at 40 you start declining, and I feel like Im getting good now.Federico Ardila DJing at the 2017 Life Is Living Festival in Oakland.JASON HENRY/QUANTA MAGAZINEAlmost a decade ago you founded a DJ collective based in Oakland. How does that tie into your work as a mathematician and teacher?When I DJ Im really looking for joy, and Im looking to create an atmosphere where people can build bridges and connect. My professor side comes out a little bit, because I play a lot of stuff that people dont know, and I try to play music from many places that they havent thought about.I also see music as a tool for social change. Some of the events I do are social benefitsits about music, but its also about feeding the soul and getting ready for the change that you want to make in the world. It feels very similar to the kind of atmosphere that I try to create in a classroom. I see all of these things as being connected.Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

b'Imagine a world without grapes. Someday greenhouses like the one above may be our last defense against such a fate. Beneath the glow of high-voltage lamps, dozens of crop samples grow at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. Here, Cornell University scientists crossbreed domesticated crops with their wild ancestors to propagate superhardy strains that better withstand droughts, heat waves, and freezes. The facility is one of more than 50 such USDA-funded research stations nationwide, where scientists are studying climate-resilient produce. They use techniques such as genotyping (scanning plant genomes to identify specific, beneficial genes) and tissue culture analysis to capture the desirable traits of feral plantslike heat or cold toleranceand introduce them into common crops. In his new book,Human Nature, photographer Lucas Foglia documents these agricultural experiments as a rumination on the intersection of nature and technology. Its amazing to me that the future of our food is being developed in these simple greenhouses, Foglia says. But the stations understated exterior belies the advanced science within. Blight-proof peppers, disease-repelling grapes, and rot-resistant raspberries ripen just behind the frosty glass.A pineapple shoot grows in a test tube at the National Laboratory for Genetic Resource Preservation in Fort Collins, Colorado. Plant samples are frozen as backup clones in the event of a destructive climate event or disease. Its a pineapple in case of disaster, Foglia says.\nLUCAS_FOGLIAThis article appears in the December issue. Subscribe now.

b'I cant sit here and promise you that the robot apocalypse isnt coming, that the machines wont eventually rise up and overthrow their makers. But what I can promise you is that not all of them will be able to punch you out. Because robots are going soft. Like, literally soft, controlled with liquid or air instead of traditional motors. Its called soft robotics, naturally, and its hot at the moment.Problem, though: Without the rigidity and powerful motors of your typical robot, soft robots have been weak. That is, until now. Researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Harvards Wyss Institute have developed a new kind of soft robotic muscle inspired by origami and awesomeness. Its essentially a bag filled with air, inside of which is an origami structure that functions as a skeleton. By pumping air in and out, the researchers can get the muscle to lift 1,000 times its own weight. By comparison, a more traditional robot arm like the super popular UR10, which weighs in at 64 pounds, can lift a third of its weight.That\'s really amazing, if you think about it, you lift 1,000 times more than what you weigh, says roboticist Daniela Rus of MIT CSAIL. So we think that this will be really transformational for how we use soft robots in manufacturing, in homes, in everyday life.MIT CSAILThe secret is that skeleton. Without it, you could get a soft robotic muscle to contract, sure. Think Baymax from Big Hero 6, who can deflate and squeeze through windows. But in reality, a soft robot like that wouldnt be very strong. The skeleton gives you both strength and the ability to start messing with how the muscle moves.So for instance, if you want to do a straight-up lifting motion, an accordion-style skeleton might work best. But you might also 3-D print other origami shapes to execute other maneuvers. Through those different patterns, we\'re able to actuate rotational motions or twisting motions, Rus says.You could then also combine these different muscles as modules to form a more complicated robot, like the one at the top of this story. The fingers bend inward to grasp the tire, while the stem contracts upwards to lift.The beauty of this kind of system is its literal and figurative flexibility. Just as you could combine different muscles, you could work with different materials for the skin. So you\'d use silicone, for instance, to resist heat, but you could also use materials that dissolve in water to make a disposable aquatic robot.Soft robots would get along with humans better, which means robots will collaborate with us, not outright steal our jobs. Sure, they\'ll be extremely strong, but they\'ll also be extremely sensitive. Robotic arms like the UR10 I mentioned earlier already stop if they make contact with a human, and expect the softies to do the same. So the soft robots of the near future will combine brawn and gentleness, making them even safer than "hard" devices. Like Andr the Giant, only with fewer sideburns.The next step? Making a soft robotic elephant. Scaled down, of course. I like the elephant trunk because it\'s such a sophisticated manipulation mechanism, Rus says.Let\'s also get a robotic avatar of Andr the Giant while we\'re at it. Maybe Andr riding an elephant. Yeah, there we go.
